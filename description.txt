Rune Carver adds six new weapons which can be "empowered" six times as the game progresses.
This mod currently includes:
    * The Rune Carver, a machine which, given certain materials, carves runes into compatible weapons, making them more powerful
    * Exultion, a long spear which can stab your opponents from afar
    * Exodium, a sword which fires a fast-moving projectile
    * Colstice, a shotgun which fires a tight spread of five bullets
    * Cellcrusher, a bow which fires two arrows instead of one
    * Ash, a staff which rapidly fires fireballs
    * Auger Arcanum, a railgun which fires a solid laser to cleave your opponents into two
