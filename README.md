# Rune Carver
Rune Carver adds six new weapons which can be "empowered" six times as the game progresses.
This mod currently includes:
* The Rune Carver, a machine which, given certain materials, carves runes into compatible weapons, making them more powerful
* Exultion, a long spear which can stab your opponents from afar
* Exodium, a sword which fires a fast-moving projectile
* Colstice, a shotgun which fires a tight spread of five bullets
* Cellcrusher, a bow which fires two arrows instead of one
* Ash, a staff which rapidly fires fireballs
* Auger Arcanum, a railgun which fires a solid laser to cleave your opponents into two
